* [D] Allow running before middlewares for every instance, common, and both tasks
* [T] Allow running before middlewares as taskcontrol-task for every instance, common, and both tasks  
* [D] Allow running after middlewares for every instance, common, and both tasks 
* [T] Allow running after middlewares as taskcontrol-task for every instance, common, and both tasks  
* [D] Add merging two workflow instances 
* [W] Add ordered workflow runs 
* [W] Add workflow name clashes inside an instance
* [W] Add allowing of repetitive tasks using schedular
* [T] Run PreCreated Tasks
* [W] Add plugin system
* [W] Add pre-created workflow script list/array
* [T] Add plugin system with No config addition from a plugin main file
* [W] Add cleaner logging system for monitoring with 
        - memory/console logging, 
        - file logging, 
        - server/ remote logging
* [T] Logging & Concurrency for logger (Concurrency can be added)
* [W] Consider adding concurrent support:
        - multithreading, 
        - multiprocessing, 
        - async/await options
* [W] Actions support
* [W] Services+Hooks support
* [T] Check impact of self on closure (Low priority)
* [T] Consider adding decorator generator in utils like https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.0.x/
* [T] Consider dynamic args and kwargs (High Priority)
        - 3 use cases of dynamic arguments
                - function returns invoked and returning args/ kwargs during execution of task
                - task returns invoked and returning args/ kwargs during execution of task
        - test for:
                - function returns invoked immediately and returning args/ kwargs during execution of task
                - task returns invoked immediately and returning args/ kwargs before execution of task

** [W] Add Tests
        Add all variations of tests for 
                - decorator, args, and kwargs
                - function, args, and kwargs
                - before and after middlewares
                - run single task and multiple tasks
        Add unit tests for main functions
* [T] Test support for async-await in base
        - (just need tests for async await for current single task flow logic)
* [T] Test support for multi-threading, multiprocessing & in base
        - (test current single task flow logic)
* [T] Test support for Services, Actions, Hooks

** [T] Config text based workflow Definition
* Add yaml, json config consumption for workflow script list/array
* Add UI for yaml, json creation and consumption

** [T] Monitoring Workflows - ./admin/monitor.py
* [C?] Add Tasks, script list status Monitoring UI - 
* [C?] Add Analytics UI - Consider Third party UIs
* [C?] Consider Workflow/Tasks tracking system and Dashboard with its own progress and logging
* [C?] Consider compatibility to Chef/CircleCI/Github/Other Automation tools, atleast as external added plugins
* [T] Planned Integrations with Subversioning, Build Tools, Deployment, Data Transformation / Analytics Tooling, Testing, and Infrastructure toolings (List generation pending)
* [T] Check Queue features compare https://github.com/FabrizioBrancati/Queuer and MQ and Rabbit for 
        the pub-sub queue in ./admin/pubsubpublisher.py after adding the concurrency
* [T] Agent based Client-Server Plugins ./admin/agentclient.py, ./admin/agentserver.py
* [T] Agent-less based SSH support Plugins ./admin/ssh.py
* [T] PubSub Queue Message Queue - ./admin/pubsubpublisher.py
* [T] PubSub Queue Server Agent - ./admin/pubsubqueueserver.py
* [T] PubSub Queue Subscriber Agent - ./admin/pubsubsubscriber.py
* [T] Monitor - ./admin/monitor.py
* [T] Git - ./admin/git.py
* [T] Communication plus REST API Server - ./admin/communicationserver.py
* [T] WebHook Server - ./admin/webhookserver.py
* [T] WebHook Client - ./admin/webhookclient.py
* [T] Compatibility to https://www.amqp.org/
